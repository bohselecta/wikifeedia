Unlike most animals, octopuses have a decentralized nervous system with two-thirds of neurons located in their arms. Scientists have observed them using tools, solving puzzles, and expressing distinct personalities. They can change color and texture in milliseconds to blend with their environment.",

Her research on radioactivity was groundbreaking but ultimately fatal. Her notebooks remain so radioactive they're stored in lead-lined boxes. She died from aplastic anemia caused by radiation exposure, as she and her contemporaries didn't understand the dangers.",

The plan involved surgically implanting listening devices and radio transmitters into cats, then releasing them near targets. The project failed spectacularly when the first test cat immediately wandered away and was hit by a taxi. The CIA concluded cats were 'too independent and uncontrollable' to be good operatives.",

A 1918 flu epidemic left corpses still perfectly preserved in ice, complete with intact viruses. Scientists discovered live samples of the 1918 influenza virus in the permafrost. Terminally ill residents must leave before death to prevent reintroducing ancient diseases.",

The Pantheon's unreinforced concrete dome, built in 126 AD, shows no structural problems 2,000 years later. Roman engineers added volcanic ash (pozzolana) to their concrete. When seawater seeped into Roman harbor structures, chemical reactions made the concrete stronger over centuries. Scientists are now reverse-engineering Roman concrete for modern construction.",
